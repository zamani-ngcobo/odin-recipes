        <h3>Unbelievable Chicken</h3>
        <p>
          The "Unbelievable Chicken" is a culinary masterpiece that begins with
          a perfect sear, locking in the juices and creating a crispy,
          golden-brown skin that crackles with every bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secret lies in a masterful blend of herbs and spices—a symphony of
          smoked paprika, fragrant thyme, and a hint of cayenne—that infuses the
          meat with a deep, complex flavor.

        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Mix cider vinegar, mustard, garlic, lime juice, lemon juice, brown
            sugar, salt, and pepper together in a large glass or ceramic bowl.
            Whisk in olive oil. Add chicken and toss evenly to coat. Cover, and
            marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.
          </li>
          <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat.</li>
          <li>
            Lightly oil the grill grate. Place chicken on the preheated grill,
            and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, until juices run clear. Discard
            any remaining marinade.
