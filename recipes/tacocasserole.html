        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a
            9x13-baking dish with cooking spray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground
            beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in salsa, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed,
            about 20 minutes. Stir in beans; cook until heated through.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread crushed tortilla chips over the bottom of the baking dish;
            spoon beef mixture on top. Spread sour cream over beef, then
            sprinkle olives, green onion, and tomatoes on top. Cover with
            Cheddar cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
