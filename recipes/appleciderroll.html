        <h3>Apple Cider Hawaiian Roll Donuts</h3>
        <p>
          These Apple Cider Hawaiian Roll Donuts are a delightful twist on a
          classic fall treat, bringing together the warm, spiced notes of apple
          cider with the soft, fluffy texture of a Hawaiian roll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each donut is a perfect bite of autumn, boasting a light, airy crumb
          that melts in your mouth and a subtle, tangy sweetness from the cider.
          They are generously coated in a cinnamon-sugar blend, creating a
          crispy, fragrant exterior that perfectly complements the rich, tender
          interior.

          <li>
            2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as
            Alpine Spiced Apple Cider®)
          </li>
          <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>

        <h3>Steps :</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>
            Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each
            one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening
            and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon
            filling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet
            apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with
            melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden
            brown, 12 to 14 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and
            cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in
            sugar mixture.
          </li>
        </ol>
